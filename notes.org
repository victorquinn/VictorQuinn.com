       I type with the Dvorak keyboard layout on a Kinesis Advantage keyboard while using Emacs as my 
       primary tool to write code. I remap Control to Caps Lock to help me fly and I’m an efficiency junkie
       who is always looking for ways to improve my workflow. I’m passionate about a great many things in
       the world of computing, but a few of my favorites are databases, architecture, and clean API design.
